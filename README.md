# Social-Network-API-w-NoSQL
 API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.


## Description

This project focuses on developing an API for a social network web application, leveraging MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to handle large volumes of unstructured data efficiently. The application allows users to share thoughts, react to others' thoughts, and build a friend list. Technologies used include Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose ODM for data modeling. The API is designed with robust routes to manage users, thoughts, reactions, and friendships.
